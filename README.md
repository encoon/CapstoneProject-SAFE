# CapstoneProject-SAFE
University of Utah capstone project, team SAFE repository<br/>
Project started in Feb 2024.
Demo day on 12/06 2024.

## Content
Team SAFE has been made up for a project making a product that determines the fatigue point of the muscle. We are using an EMG sensor from a company called 'Myoware', using sesnor Myoware 2.0. The fatigue point gets calculated by using fatigue coefficient by using raspberry pi 4, a grove base hat inverter, and alerts the user with a designed alerting circuit PCB. Refer to the block diagram below.
